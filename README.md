# Minimal webpack boilerplate

Have you ever been overwhelmed by the magnitude of settings and tweaks in some webpack boilerplates to the point where you were too scared to change anything in fear of breaking it?
Fear no more! This boilerplate is the bare minimum to get your vanilla javascript development up and running with the awesome webpack-dev-server and a basic webpack production build.

## Setup

1. Download or clone this repository and use it as template for your project:
   https://github.com/1st8/minimal-webpack-boilerplate/archive/master.zip
2. Install the dependencies via `npm install`
3. Start the dev server via `npm start` and browse to http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/ or http://localhost:8080/
4. Study the files in the `src` folder to see how `require` and `module.exports` work.
5. Update files in the `src` folder and see how the changes are hot loaded into your browser

## Usage

Start dev server
`npm start`

Build for production
`npm run build`

Clean builds
`npm run clean`
